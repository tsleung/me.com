# Decode Your Decisions
## Price Defines You
Every desired object carries two prices. The listed price, set by the seller, represents their desired gain. Yet, a second, more crucial price exists: YOUR price.  This internal valuation reflects the object's true worth *to you*, dictating your choices and shaping your life's trajectory.


## 1. Listed Price vs. Your Price

```js
Plot.plot({
  marks: [
    Plot.ruleY([1000], {label: "Listed Price"}), // Listed Price
    Plot.ruleY([800], {label: "Your Price"})   // Your Price
  ],
  x: {domain: ["Smartphone Model A"]}, // Product Name
  y: {label: "Price"}
})
```

This simple graph visualizes the two prices: the listed price and your personal valuation.


## 2. Multiple "Your Prices"

```js
const yourPrices = [750, 900, 1100, 800, 600, 1200, 950]; // Example data

const chart = Plot.plot({
  marks: [
    Plot.dot(yourPrices, {x: "Smartphone Model A", y: d => d, stroke: "blue"}),
    Plot.ruleY([1000], {label: "Listed Price"})  // Listed Price
 ],
  x: {domain: ["Smartphone Model A"]},
  y: {label: "Price"}
})
display(chart)
```

Now consider multiple individuals desiring the same product.  Each dot represents their unique "Your Price". This illustrates the subjectivity of value.


## 3. Market Conditions & Shifting Prices

```js
const marketCondition = {
  type: "range",
  min: -100, 
  max: 100, 
  value: 0   
};

const chart = Plot.plot({
  marks: [
    Plot.dot(yourPrices, {
      x: "Smartphone Model A", 
      y: (d) => d + marketCondition.value, 
      stroke: "blue"
    }),
    Plot.ruleY([1000 + marketCondition.value], {label: "Listed Price"}) // Dynamic Listed Price
  ],
  x: {domain: ["Smartphone Model A"]},
  y: {label: "Price"}
})

display(chart)
```

External forces (market conditions) influence our valuations. Use the slider to see how "Your Prices" shift.

## 4. Evolving Values Over Time

```js
const careerOptions = [
  {name: "Finance", financialSecurity: 9, creativeFulfillment: 3},
  {name: "Art", financialSecurity: 3, creativeFulfillment: 9},
  {name: "Teaching", financialSecurity: 5, creativeFulfillment: 7},
  {name: "Entrepreneurship", financialSecurity: 7, creativeFulfillment: 8}
];

const time = {
  type: "range",
  min: 0, 
  max: 10, 
  value: 0
};

const chart = Plot.plot({
  marks: [
    Plot.dot(careerOptions, {
      x: "financialSecurity", 
      y: "creativeFulfillment", 
      r: (d) => 4 + (d.financialSecurity * (10-time.value)/10) + (d.creativeFulfillment * time.value/10), // Size based on time & initial radius
      title: d => d.name,
      fill: "blue" 
    })
  ],
  x: {label: "Financial Security"},
  y: {label: "Creative Fulfillment"}
})
display(chart)
```

"Your Price" isn't static. It evolves with time and experience. Watch the relative "price" of different career options change over time.

## Conclusion

The listed price matters less than YOUR price. Cultivate this internal compass. Understand its shifts. Know your price. Navigate life's marketplace with clarity. Craft a future reflecting your true values.
